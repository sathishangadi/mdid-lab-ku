        <h2>Research Focus</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>Metabolic Disorders & Infectious Diseases Research Lab (MDID Lab)</strong> explores a wide range of biological and biomedical challenges with a special focus on the intersection between <strong>metabolic dysfunctions</strong> and <strong>infectious diseases</strong>. Our multidisciplinary projects use both experimental and computational approaches to understand disease mechanisms and identify novel drug candidates.
        </p>

        <h3>ðŸ”¬ Major Research Areas</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Anti-HIV Drug Discovery:</strong> Screening and identification of novel CCR5 antagonists, integrase inhibitors, and reverse transcriptase blockers through <em>in silico</em> molecular docking, pharmacophore modeling, and ADMET profiling.</li>
            <li><strong>Metabolic Disorders:</strong> Investigating bioactive compounds with anti-diabetic and anti-obesity properties using enzymatic inhibition assays and molecular simulations.</li>
            <li><strong>Computational Biology:</strong> Employing bioinformatics and cheminformatics tools for virtual screening, QSAR analysis, and molecular dynamics simulations to predict drug efficacy.</li>
            <li><strong>Phytochemistry & Ethnobotany:</strong> Identifying therapeutic compounds from medicinal plants traditionally used in Indian systems of medicine.</li>
