        <h2>About the Lab</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>Metabolic Disorders & Infectious Diseases Research Laboratory (MDID Lab)</strong> at the Department of Zoology, Kakatiya University, focuses on integrative research addressing the dual challenges of <strong>metabolic syndromes</strong> and <strong>infectious diseases</strong>. 
            Our multidisciplinary approach combines <strong>molecular biology, bioinformatics, pharmacology, and biotechnology</strong> to identify novel therapeutic agents from natural sources and computational methods.
        </p>

        <h3>About the Principal Investigator</h3>
